 Bank.py - The purpose of this project is to simulate an ATM machine by allowing the user to make transactions such as
 withdrawals, deposits, transfers, balance inquiries. Upon running the program the user starts with a $20,000 savings account
 balance and $2,000 checking account balance. With each transaction the balance of the checking and savings account are updated
 to show the new balance of each account.
