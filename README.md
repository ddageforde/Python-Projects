 Bank.py - The purpose of this project is to simulate an ATM machine by allowing the user to make transactions such as
 withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and balance inquiries. Upon running the program the user starts with a $20,000 savings account
 balance and $2,000 checking account balance. With each transaction the balance of the checking and savings account are updated
 so that if the user makes a balance inquiry the new balance of that account is shown. If the user tries to withdraw more money than they have in the checkings or savings 
 account a statement prints telling the user how much money they have in the account and to please re-enter a smaller amount.
