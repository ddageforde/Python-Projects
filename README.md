 Bank.py - The purpose of this project is to simulate an ATM machine by allowing the user to make transactions such as
 withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and balance inquiries. Upon running the program the user starts with a $20,000 savings account
 balance and $2,000 checking account balance. With each transaction the balance of the checking and savings account are updated
 so that if the user makes a balance inquiry the new balance of that account is shown. If the user tries to withdraw more money than they have in the checkings or savings 
 account a statement prints telling the user how much money they have in the account and to please re-enter a smaller amount.
 
 Yahtzee.py - This is a Yahtzee game in which I learned to work with Python's most commonly used GUI framework Tkinter. The PIL
 library, collections module, random module, and io module are also used in this program. The game provides an interface for the user to click
 on the dice they wish to keep after each roll and radio buttons to choose a category to chart their score in. A scorecard is 
 provided as well and is accessible for the user to view at any point in the game to see which categories they have charted so far.
 There is a calculate final score button used to add up the total of all categories at the end of the game and then tells the user
 whether they won or lost against a random computer score.
